## 4. Algorithms

_As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide
the future course of the science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid,
the question will then arise &mdash; by what course of calculation
can these results be arrived at by the machine in the shortest time?_<br>
